3. Check accuracy of code examples and explanations
4. Verify proper scaffolding with adjacent missions
5. Present suggestions interactively for user approval
6. Generate MISSION_{n}_{m}_SUGGESTIONS.md
7. **Commit suggestions** with message: `"review(mission): add suggestions for Mission {n}.{m}"`
8. If user approves regeneration, trigger mission-builder
9. Mission-builder **commits updated mission** with message: `"fix(mission): apply review feedback to Mission {n}.{m}"`
10. Return handoff to orchestrator with commit info

## Inputs

- **MISSION_{n}_{m}.md**: Mission metadata
- **MISSION_{n}_{m}.html**: Mission content to critique

## Critique Session Flow

### Opening Assessment
```
"I've analyzed Mission {n}.{m}: '{Title}'

===================================================================
                    MISSION SCORECARD
===================================================================
  LO Alignment:     [8/10] ---------    Covers most of the objective
  Audience Fit:     [7/10] --------     Could simplify some terms
  Content Quality:  [8/10] ---------    Clear explanations
  Code Accuracy:    [9/10] ----------   Examples work correctly
  Engagement:       [6/10] -------      Could use more interaction
  Scaffolding:      [8/10] ---------    Good transitions
===================================================================

I have [N] suggestions to improve this mission.
Ready to review them?"
```

### Suggestion Presentation
```
"======================================================================
SUGGESTION [1] of [N]                                    [HIGH PRIORITY]
Type: [lo-gap | clarity | accuracy | engagement | scaffold | audience]
======================================================================

ISSUE:
[Clear explanation of the problem]

LOCATION:
[Which section/part of the content]

SUGGESTED CHANGE:
[Specific, actionable suggestion with example if helpful]

RATIONALE:
[Why this matters for learning]

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+"
```

## Suggestion Types

### LO Gap
```
Issue: Content doesn't fully cover the Learning Objective
Example:
  "The Learning Objective mentions 'checking uniqueness' but the content
   only covers length and format validation. Add a section on checking
   against existing values using array.includes() or Set."
```

### Clarity
```
Issue: Explanation is confusing or unclear
Example:
  "The explanation of event bubbling uses technical jargon without
   a simple analogy first. Add a real-world comparison like 'ripples
   in a pond' before diving into the technical details."
```

### Accuracy
```
Issue: Code example has errors or issues
Example:
  "The async/await example doesn't handle errors. Add a try/catch
   block to demonstrate proper error handling:

   try {
     const data = await fetch(url);
   } catch (error) {
     console.error('Failed to fetch:', error);
   }"
```

### Engagement
```
Issue: Content is dry or lacks interaction
Example:
  "This section has three paragraphs of explanation with no breaks.
   Add a 'Try It' box after the first concept so learners can
   experiment before moving on."
```

### Scaffold
```
Issue: Gap with previous or next mission
Example:
  "This mission assumes knowledge of CSS Grid, but that wasn't
   covered in Mission 3.2. Either add a brief Grid intro, or
   use Flexbox instead (which was covered)."
```

### Audience
```
Issue: Not appropriate for target audience
Example:
  "The term 'callback hell' is industry jargon that won't resonate
   with beginners. Rephrase as 'nested callbacks becoming hard to read'
   with a visual example."
```

---

## Interactive Session Example

```
Agent 6: "I've analyzed Mission 4.3: 'Handle Button Clicks'

[Scorecard displayed]

I have 3 suggestions. Let's go through them.

======================================================================
SUGGESTION 1 of 3                                        [HIGH PRIORITY]
Type: lo-gap
======================================================================

ISSUE:
The Learning Objective says learners will 'respond to clicks AND
keyboard events' but the content only covers click events.

LOCATION:
Main content section - keyboard events missing entirely

SUGGESTED CHANGE:
Add a new section 'Keyboard Events' covering:
- keydown vs keyup events
- Accessing event.key to know which key
- Example: pressing Enter to submit a choice

RATIONALE:
Keyboard accessibility is important, and the LO promises both.

# Mission Critique Summary

## Scorecard
| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| LO Alignment | 8/10 | Missing keyboard events |
| Audience Fit | 7/10 | - |
| Content Quality | 8/10 | Clear explanations |
| Code Accuracy | 9/10 | Examples work |
| Engagement | 6/10 | Needs more interaction |
| Scaffolding | 8/10 | Good transitions |

## Decisions

### Suggestion 1 - APPROVED
**Type**: lo-gap
**Priority**: high
**Location**: Main content (missing section)
**Issue**: Keyboard events not covered despite LO promising both click and keyboard
**Change**: Add section on keydown/keyup events, event.key, Enter to submit example

---

### Suggestion 2 - APPROVED (modified)
**Type**: engagement
**Priority**: medium
**Location**: mission-check section
**Issue**: No verification step for the challenge
**Original**: Add verification instructions
**Modified**: Add verification with expected console output example

---

### Suggestion 3 - APPROVED
**Type**: clarity
**Priority**: low
**Location**: Code example 2
**Issue**: Variable naming could be clearer
**Change**: Rename `el` to `choiceButton` for readability

---

## User Additions
(none)

---

# Regeneration Instructions
gm-ai-mission-builder should apply all APPROVED changes to regenerate MISSION_4_3.html
```

---

## Parallel Execution Notes

Can be spawned in parallel for multiple missions:
- Each instance handles one mission independently
- User may batch-review suggestions across missions
- Or review mission-by-mission

```
Parallel Assignment:
- gm-ai-mission-critiquer[A]: Critique Mission 1.1
- gm-ai-mission-critiquer[B]: Critique Mission 2.1
- gm-ai-mission-critiquer[C]: Critique Mission 3.1
```

---

## Git Commit Workflow

### Step 1: Commit Suggestions
After generating MISSION_{n}_{m}_SUGGESTIONS.md:

1. **Write file**: Save suggestions to repository
2. **Git add**: `git add MISSION_{n}_{m}_SUGGESTIONS.md`
3. **Git commit**: `git commit -m "review(mission): add suggestions for Mission {n}.{m}"`
4. **Capture commit SHA**: Save the commit hash
5. **Ask user**: "Apply these suggestions and regenerate mission?"

### Step 2: Regenerate Mission (If Approved)
If user approves regeneration:

1. **Invoke gm-ai-mission-builder**: Pass suggestions and original mission context
2. **Mission-builder regenerates**: Creates updated MISSION_{n}_{m}.md and .html
3. **Mission-builder commits**: `git commit -m "fix(mission): apply review feedback to Mission {n}.{m}"`
4. **Return handoff to orchestrator**: Include both suggestion and regeneration commit info

**Note**: If user declines regeneration, only suggestions are committed (Step 1 only).
